## Game of Life

Welcome to the Game of Life, a fascinating cellular automaton simulation implemented in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This project brings to life the rules of Conway's Game of Life, where cells evolve based on a set of simple rules.

### üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview

The Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton simulation where each cell in a grid evolves over time based on its neighboring cells. The simulation follows specific rules, creating visually captivating patterns that emerge from seemingly simple interactions.

### üåü Key Features

- **Cellular Automaton Simulation**: Implements Conway's Game of Life rules for cellular automaton simulation.

- **SFML Graphics**: Utilizes the SFML library for graphics rendering, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

- **Grid Representation**: Represents the cellular grid where each cell evolves according to predefined rules.

- **User Interaction**: Allows user interaction to start, stop, and reset the simulation.

- **Pattern Visualization**: Visualizes interesting patterns and structures that emerge during the simulation.

### üöÄ How to Run

To run the Game of Life project, follow these steps:

1. **Install SFML**: Ensure the SFML library is installed on your system. Refer to the [SFML installation guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for your platform.
